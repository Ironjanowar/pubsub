* Let's make a Publisher/Subscriber!!
The idea of this repo is to learn some beautiful Elixir making a
pub/sub system!

But we're going to do it in different ways:
  - [X] Basic pub/sub (Only processes in Elixir/Erlang)
  - [ ] Advanced pub/sub with behaviours: GenStage, GenServer, Agent ... (Again only in Elixir/Erlang)
  - [ ] Separating the broker functionalities in case it needed to scale


* Branches
Once a version is completed we'll create a new branch
*language/version*.

But... wait a minute... *language* ??

YES! If anyone wants to do it in any other language is very welcome!!
